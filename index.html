            This is an introductory page. Created during lesson 3 of Elbrus
            bootcamp. A business card website is a small website with brief
            information about me and my professional activities. In the future,
            I look forward to real application in the employment process, to be
            provided to applicants. Thanks to her, the organization will become
            familiar with my portfolio quite quickly. More information will be

            About Me
          </h3>
          <p class="main-info-text inter-tight">
            My journey in life began in the city of Rossosh, June 13, 1994 year,
            monday üòä. He graduated from 11 classes, upon reaching adulthood he
            moved to the city of Belgorod, where he received a higher economic
            education at the National Research University "BelSU". I found
            myself serving in the army for 1 year, where, in addition to the
            generally accepted education, I learned the ‚Äúschool of life.‚Äù He
            began to build a career in the specialty ‚Äúfinance and credit‚Äù. My
            first place of work was "VTB" Bank, where me began building me
            future career as a credit specialist, and was also noted by its
            managers as promising. After 2 years, my department head offered me
            the position of business development manager at "Rosgosstrakh" Bank.
            Over the past 2 years of work in our region, we have taken leading
            positions in the field of car lending. I received an offer from
            "Expobank" for the position of regional director, where I already
            managed 3 regions: Belgorod region, Bryansk region, Smolensk region.
            The start of a special Russian military operation in Ukraine made
            adjustments to my ambitions. SVO fatally affected the business, as a
            result of which positions were cut, and I migrated to "Otkritie"
            Bank to the position of head of the auto business center. With a
            quick takeoff, there was also a painful fall. At my last workplace,
            I came to the realization that I needed to change the field...

            But first, look at a couple of photos with my team:

            If you decide to leave the field to which you have devoted so many
            years of your life and achieved so many heights, you can assume that
            it is due to professional burnout. Partly. Many factors affected
            this. In short, the acceptance of digital currencies by our state,
            the desire not to be tied to one location, but to travel (I mainly
            came to this because of the situation in the city where I live),
            that this is a related industry with cryptocurrencies, well, I still
            want cleanse karma after working in a bank. Well, the main trigger
            was a trip to Thailand, where I had time to think about everything
            and make a decision to change my life.
